# Who am I?

My name is Jordan and I'm a recent graduate of biology/ecology. Though my undergraduate thesis fit the theme of preedation ecology [The Rodent Eats the Raptor](https://digitalccbeta.coloradocollege.edu/pid/coccc:31273 "My Thesis!"), I am most interested in working with birds in the areas of spatial ecology. More specifically, I am most interested in topics such as migration, habitat selection, and interactions between resident and migrant birds.

## Why make this page?

Thus far, all my coding has been what I've been able to figure out analyzing various datasets in R. I've decided that maybe it's time to start sharing some of the code that I've been working on.
